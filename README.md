# Arduino Libraries for Spectra Project

Library files must be zipped into the `/zips` subfolder to be automatically downloaded and installed. If a package already exists in the Arduino's library repository, it is preferred to update the [Ansible script](https://github.com/fotobiolab-unb/spectrum/blob/master/reactors/ansible-script.yml) instead (line 81 on "Installing Zips" section).
